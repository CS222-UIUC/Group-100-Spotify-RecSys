# Group-100-Spotify-RecSys

Music is a universal language for everyone. As someone who enjoys listening to and discovering new music (with >1500 songs in one of ours' favorites playlist), we wanted an option to discover new listening tastes. We want to be able to create a recommendation service for users to find new music relative to the aspects of the songs they listen to and search for : ex. Genre, bpm, key, artist, track. We wanted to diverge from traditional recommendation systems by also including more niche information about the artist or song lyrics. This could give a user a more in-depth enjoyable experience that feels more connected, than a typical impersonal recommendation.
